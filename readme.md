# IESO Bayesian Load Forecasting
To use the data without running the scripts to collect the data, it's available here. You'll need the weather data on this link directly. Github has pretty small file limits.

If you do want to rebuild the data, run each file in scripts, or run the makefile. 

After that, go ahead and run the notebooks. If you already have all the data from the Google Drive, it doesn't matter which order you run the notebooks. Otherwise, run in order of RQ.


Pipeline:

IESO API -> csv -> sklearn
